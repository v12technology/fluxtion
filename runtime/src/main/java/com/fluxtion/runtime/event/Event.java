 * <p>
 * Event class that feeds into a Simple Event Processor(SEP) providing additional 
 * meta-data about the incoming event. The additional data provided is:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Filtering</li>
 * <li>Event creation time</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h2>Dispatch</h2>
 * A user creates an Event and publishes it to a SEP for handling via the
 * {@link com.fluxtion.runtime.StaticEventProcessor#onEvent(Object)} method.<p>
 *
 * To dispatch the events within the SEP Fluxtion uses the class name to perform
 * a dispatch. When class name is used, uniqueness is guaranteed by using the
 * fully qualified class name.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Filtering</h2>
 *
 * An event can provide a filter field as either an int or a String, this allow
 * {@link FilteredEventHandler}'s or annotated event handler methods to filter
 * the type of events they receive. The SEP will compare the filter values in
 * the {@link Event} and the handler and propagate the Event conditional upon a
 * valid match.
