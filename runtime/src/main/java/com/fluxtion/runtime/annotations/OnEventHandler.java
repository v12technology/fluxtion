/**
 * Marks a method as an entry point to an execution path contained with the
 * execution graph. An event handler is invoked on the event in phase of
 * execution processing. A SEP processes event handling methods in two phases:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Event in phase - processes handler methods in topological order
 * <li>After event phase - processes handler methods in reverse topological
 * order
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *
 * Fluxtion reads the set
 * of entry points and constructs an execution graph at build time. A valid
 * event handler method accepts a single parameter of type
 * {@link com.fluxtion.runtime.event.Event} and optionally returns a boolean value
 * or void.
 * The boolean value indicates if a change has occurred during the processing of
 * the event.
 *
 * <h2>Conditional processing</h2>
 * If conditional
 * processing is enabled for the SEP, the following
 * strategy is employed for interpreting notification and branching
 * execution:
 * <ul>
 * <li>return = true : indicates a change has occurred processing the event
 * <li>return = false : indicates a change has NOT occurred processing the event
 * <li>return = void : assumes a change has occurred processing the event
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * 
 * Conditional branching execution behaves as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>if a change is indicated the execution will propagate along the execution
 * path.
 * <li>No change notification will remove this node from the current execution
 * path.
 * </ul>
 *
* <h2>Filtering</h2>
 * An EventHandler can optionally provide a filter value and match strategy to
 * specialise the events that are accepted for processing, see {@link #value()
 * }. An
 * {@link Event} can optionally specify a filter value {@link Event#filterString()
 * }. The
 * SEP will compare the filter values in the {@link Event} and the handler and
 * propagate
 * the Event conditional upon the {@link FilterType}.
 * .<p>
 *
 * A node must be in the execution graph to be included in the invocation chain.
 * The Fluxtion builder api provides methods to register an instance in the
 * event processor.
