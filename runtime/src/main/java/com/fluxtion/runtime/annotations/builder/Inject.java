/**
 * Marks a reference as an injection point for an instance. An injected instance
 * is created using a NodeFactory, see Fluxtion builder module.
 * <p>
 *
 * If no NodeFactory is implemented for this type then a zero argument
 * constructor will be used to inject the reference. Properties of the injected
 * instance will be set using the configuration map, where keys are the member
 * properties of the class.<p>
 *
 * Once an injected instance has been created it will be added to the SEP
 * execution graph as if a user had added the node manually. The injected node
 * will be inspected for annotations and processed by the Fluxtion Static Event
 * Compiler. New injected instances are recursively inspected until no more
 * injected instances are added to the execution graph. The recursive addition
 * of injected instances allows arbitrarily complex execution graphs be created
 * with a single {@literal @}Inject annotation.<p>
 *
 * Injected references can be configured using {@link ConfigVariable} and
 * {@link Config} annotations.
