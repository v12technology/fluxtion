/**
 * Marks a handler method as a member of an execution path on the event in phase.
 * This method will be invoked invoked in topological order during the event in phase, i.e. after all its
 * dependencies on the execution path have processed the event.<p>
 *
 * A SEP processes event handling methods in two phases:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Event in phase - processes handler methods in topological order
 * <li>After event phase - processes handler methods in reverse topological
 * order
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Condtional processing</h2>
 * A valid OnEvent accepts no arguments and optionally returns a boolean
 * indicating a change
 * has occurred. If conditional processing is enabled for the SEP, the following
 * strategy is employed for interpreting notification and branching execution:
 * <ul>
 * <li>return = true : indicates a change has occurred at this node
 * <li>return = false : indicates a change has NOT occurred at this node
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Dirty strategy</h2>
 * The {@link #dirty() } method controls the propagation strategy for
 * conditional branching execution.
 * <ul>
 * <li>dirty = true : invoked if any dependent returns true from their event
 * handling method
 * <li>dirty = false : invoked if any dependent returns false from their
 * event handling method
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *
 * A node must be in the execution graph to be included in the invocation chain.
 * The Fluxtion builder api provides methods to register an instance in the
 * event processor.
