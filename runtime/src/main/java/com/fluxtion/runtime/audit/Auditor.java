/**
 * Audits runtime operations of a static event processor. An Auditor receives
 * callback notifications as the user interacts with the SEP. The auditing
 * notifications are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>node registrations during {@link Lifecycle#init() }
 * <li>receipt of events
 * <li>individual node invocations on the execution path.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #auditInvocations() } controls the granularity of audit
 * information published to an Auditor. The boolean return has the following
 * effect:
 * <ul>
 * <li>true - auditor receives all lifecycle callbacks
 * <li>false - auditor receives all lifecycle callbacks except:
 * {@link #nodeInvoked(Object, String, String, Object) }
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * An Auditor can provide various meta functions for the SEP they are registered
 * with, such as:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Generic event logger
 * <li> Node state persistence strategy
 * <li> Bespoke performance monitor
 * <li> Realtime property tracer
 * <li> Commit/rollback functionality
 * <li> A profiler
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Register an implementation of the Auditor interface with SepConfig.addAuditor
 * in the builder module, registration is a build time only operation. The
 * Fluxtion compiler automatically integrates the auditor into the generated SEP.
