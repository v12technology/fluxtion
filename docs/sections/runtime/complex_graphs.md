# Complex graph event stream processing
{: .no_toc }

Complex object graphs can be bound into an [EventProcessor](https://github.com/v12technology/fluxtion/tree/{{site.fluxtion_version}}/runtime/src/main/java/com/fluxtion/runtime/EventProcessor.java) and register for event callbacks with annotations. 
The generated EventProcessor then notifies annotated callback methods according to the [dispatch rules](../core-technology#event-dispatch-rules). Any callback
method can be located at any depth in the instance hierarchy. 

his section documents the runtime event processing callback api and behaviour in more complex graphs.

The source project for the examples can be found [here]({{site.reference_examples}}/runtime-execution/src/main/java/com/fluxtion/example/reference/complexgraphs)
