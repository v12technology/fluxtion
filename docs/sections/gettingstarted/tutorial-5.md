This tutorial covers extending an existing application with new functionality and support for new event types. The reader 
should be proficient in Java, maven, git, Spring and have completed the [first lottery tutorial](tutorial-1.md) before starting
this tutorial. The project source can be found [here.]({{site.getting_started}}/tutorial5-lottery-aot).

Our goal is to demonstrate how Fluxtion code generation makes it easy and cost-effective to add new functionality to 
an existing application with confidence.

At the end of this tutorial you should understand:
