# Binding user classes to an event processor
{: .no_toc }

The Fluxtion compiler generates an event processor from a model supplied by the client. The model is the set of user classes
that are bound into the event processor. This section documents the various ways the model can be created by the developer.

## To be documented
- Event processor config
- imperative add nodes
- implicit add
- naming nodes
- uniqueness
- factory/inject
- Config for factory
- Including/excluding classes

- Declarative/functional
  - Spring
  - yaml
