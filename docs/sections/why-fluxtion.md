# What is Fluxtion


Fluxtion provides a powerful framework for building real-time streaming applications in Java, offering high performance, 
flexibility, and ease of use for developers working with streaming data. It processes billions of events per second with 
minimal latency, streamlines development and is free from vedor lock-in

{: .info }
If you have an existing system, and you want a cost-effective way to integrate stream processing and real-time AI/ML
then Fluxtion is a great fit for you.
{: .fs-4 }

* Real-time streaming compute engine <br/>
* Separates your business logic from your messaging infrastructure <br/>
* Removes vendor lock-in <br/>
* Real-time AI/ML automation <br/>


# Fluxtion sweetspot
For businesses seeking vendor flexibility, Fluxtion is a powerful streaming event processor engine. It allows you to 
isolate your core business logic from the underlying messaging infrastructure. This means you're not locked into a 
single vendor for both message delivery and stream processing.

Fluxtion can be a great fit for your business if any of the following apply

* Cost-effective Integration of stream processing into an existing system 
* Multiple messaging system inputs must be supported
* Cost-effective integration of AI/ML
* Re-use existing imperative business logic in a stream processing engine
* Zero gc, low response time requirements in the microsecond range
* Deployable to edge computing devices for realtime AI inference
* Strictly controlled auditable deployment environments
* AOT compiled for redistribution of engine
* You chose not to be locked into a single vendor

# Use cases

Fluxtion supports all the functionality of a stream processing engine and can be used in many situations. As the world
has moved to expect real time responses the deployment of stream processing is now a requirement. A business 
that relies on end of day batch processing is not positioned for today's customer demands.

* Real time pricing
* Inventory management
* Realtime monitoring and system control
* Realtime offers
* Fraud detection
* AI integration for realtime decision-making
* Data pipelines batch and realtime
* Realtime data cleansing
* Risk compliance and trade control
* Realtime stream processing
* Event driven microservices
* Edge AI processing

# Integrating Fluxtion
Embed a Fluxtion stream processing engine in your application, freeing your business logic from messaging vendor lock-in.
