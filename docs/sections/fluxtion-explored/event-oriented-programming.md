# Event oriented programming

Streaming algorithms are the secret sauce behind processing massive amounts of data in real-time, which is exactly 
what Fluxtion does! Here's a breakdown:

* Imagine data as a giant river constantly flowing in (think social media feeds, stock prices, sensor readings).
* Traditional algorithms might try to dam up this river to analyze all the data at once.  This wouldn't work for real-time situations!
* Streaming algorithms are like clever fish that can analyze the water (data) as it flows by. They use limited memory 
and only need one or few passes through the data to extract insights.


Here's why this is important for Fluxtion:

* **Real-time processing:** Fluxtion leverages streaming algorithms to analyze data as it arrives, giving you insights with minimal delay.
* **Efficiency:**  By using limited memory and quick processing, Fluxtion keeps costs down and avoids bogging down from massive data streams.
* **Scalability:** Streaming algorithms allow Fluxtion to handle ever-growing data volumes without breaking a sweat.

So, Fluxtion's power comes from these specialized algorithms that are designed for the fast-flowing world of real-time data.
