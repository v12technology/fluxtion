# The cost of complexity problem

Increasing system complexity makes delivery of new features expensive and time-consuming to deliver. Efficiently
managing
complexity reduces both operational costs and time to market for new functionality, critical for a business to remain
profitable in a competitive environment.

Event driven systems have two types of complexity to manage:

- Delivering events to application components in a fault-tolerant predictable fashion.
- Developing application logic responses to events that meets business requirements

Initially all the project complexity centres on the event delivery system, but over time this system becomes stable and
the complexity demands are minimal. Pre-packaged event delivery systems are a common solution to control complexity and
cost of event distribution. The opposite is true for event driven application logic, functional requirements increase
over time and developing application logic becomes ever more complex and expensive to deliver. As more functionality is
added the danger of instability increases.

Fluxtion reduces the cost to develop and maintain business logic, while maintaining stability. Automating the expensive
and error-prone process of wiring application logic to multiple event streams is Fluxtion's target. For long term
development
projects the ROI of using Fluxtion increases exponentially.
