{: .info }
**Fluxtion documentation is undergoing active development, please regularly check this site**
{: .fs-5 }

## Developers
For a quick introduction to programming Fluxtion visit the [hello world](helloworld/helloworld_imperative) examples.

A [developer workflow document](gettingstarted/developer-workflow) describes the approach integrating Fluxtion into your work cycle

A series of tutorials are provided that a developer should follow to become familiar with the practical coding of 
Fluxtion, start with [tutorial 1](gettingstarted/tutorial-1.md).

## Architects
For a deeper understanding of the architecture, design and paradigms that underpin Fluxtion head over to the
[Fluxtion explored section](fluxtion-explored).

## Reference documentation
* [Mark event handling](runtime.md)
* [Build event processor](build-event-processor)
* [Integrate event processor](integrate-eventprocessor)
* [Quick reference](quick-reference.md)

## Examples
A series of [cookbook examples](examples.md) are available that explore applying Fluxtion to various use cases.
