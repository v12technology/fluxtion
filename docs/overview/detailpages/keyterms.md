# What is Fluxtion

Fluxtion is a DI container that employs incremental computation and data flow programming for realtime data processing.
The Fluxtion container is like a spreadsheet on steroids where each bean is a formula cell that recalculates if any
input cell changes. As the container receives an event the dispatcher evaluates which beans are connected to the
handler and only triggers the connected beans for recalculation. 

Notification connections between beans are calculated at construction time using the same data that is used to add beans 
to the DI container and annotations that mark recalculation callback methods.

## Key terms

| Term                 | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Event                | An event is any valid java instance that is submitted to the event processor                                                                    |
| Stream               | A stream is a set of events                                                                                                                     |
| EventProcessor       | Processes the event stream with user defined logic. An EventProcessor instance is generated by Fluxtion                                         |
| Node                 | A pojo instance that is node within an EventProcessor                                                                                           |
| Event propagation    | Invoking methods in a topological order on nodes within an EventProcessor                                                                       |
| Event handler method | A method on a node that is an entry point for processing an external event                                                                      |
| Trigger method       | A method on a node that is triggered once all parent nodes have completed their trigger methods                                                 |
| Event notification   | Trigger or event handler methods notify a change by returning a boolean flag to control event propagation                                       |
| Graph space          | Construction of the meta model occurs in graph space, before generating the EventProcessor and after the user has provided all node information |


## Event dispatch
When the proxy event handler method is called on the container it dispatches with the following with logic:
-  Any top level event handler is invoked with the arguments provided
-  The event handler method indicates whether child instances should be notified with a Boolean return type
-  Any child reference defined in the DI structure is conditionally notified of the parent event handler completing processing
-  A child instance can only be notified if all of its parents have finished processing their notifications
-  The trigger method of the child returns a Boolean indicating whether the event notification should propagate
-  The container recursively works through the child references and trigger methods in the container
-  Dispatch callbacks are in strict topological order, with the event handler the root of the call tree
-  Each instance is guaranteed to be invoked at maximum once per event processing cycle
-  Any instances not connected to an executing root event handler will not be triggered in the cycle
-  Connections can be either direct or through a reference chain

# Processing events in a stream processor

There are three main steps to building and running a stream processor application using Fluxtion

## Step 1: Describe processing logic

Describe the values that are calculated and actions invoked in response to an incoming event. Fluxtion provides two
api's to describe the processing logic:

1. [A set of annotations]({{site.fluxtion_src_runtime}}/annotations)
   that mark members of user written classes as being managed by the event processor
2. [A java 8 stream like api]({{site.fluxtion_src_compiler}}/builder/stream)
   , that can describe processing with a fluent functional style

## Step 2: Build the event processor container

Fluxtion provides a eventProcessorGenerator that converts the description into an executable
[EventProcessor]({{site.fluxtion_src_runtime}}/EventProcessor.java)
instance. The eventProcessorGenerator
is invoked from
[Fluxtion]({{site.fluxtion_src_compiler}}/Fluxtion.java)
with one of two utility methods:

1. **compile**: this generates a java source code version of the EventProcessor. The file is compiled in process and
   used
   to handle events. Total nodes are limited to the number of elements a source file can handle
2. **interpret**: Creates an in memory model of the processing backed with data structures. Can support millions of
   nodes

## Step 3: Process events

Once the
[EventProcessor]({{site.fluxtion_src_runtime}}/EventProcessor.java)
has been generated the instance is ready to consume events. The EventProcessor has a lifecycle so **init must be called
before sending any events for processing**.

The application pulls events from any source and invokes ```EventProcessor#onEvent```
